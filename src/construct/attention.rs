//! Attention is a construct that occurs in the [text][] content type.
//!
//! How attention parses is too complex to explain in BNF.
//! Essentially, one or more of `*` or `_` form attention sequences.
//! Depending on the code before and after a sequence, it can open or close
//! attention.
//! When everything is parsed, we find each sequence that can close, and a
//! corresponding sequence that can open which uses the same marker.
//! If both sequences have two or more markers, strong is formed.
//! Otherwise emphasis is formed.
//!
//! Attention sequences do not, on their own, relate to anything in HTML.
//! When matched with another sequence, and two markers can be ‚Äútaken‚Äù from
//! them, they together relate to the `<strong>` element in HTML.
//! When one marker can be taken, they relate to the `<em>` element.
//! See [*¬ß 4.5.2 The `em` element*][html-em] and
//! [*¬ß 4.5.3 The `strong` element*][html-strong] in the HTML spec for more
//! info.
//!
//! It is recommended to use asterisks for attention when writing markdown.
//!
//! There are some small differences in whether sequences can open and/or close
//! based on whether they are formed with asterisks or underscores.
//! Because underscores also frequently occur in natural language inside words,
//! while asterisks typically never do, `CommonMark` prohobits underscore
//! sequences from opening or closing when *inside* a word.
//!
//! Because asterisks can be used to form the most markdown constructs, using
//! them has the added benefit of making it easier to gloss over markdown: you
//! can look for asterisks to find syntax while not worrying about other
//! characters.
