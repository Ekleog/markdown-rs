//! Constructs found in markdown.
//!
//! There are several *things* found when parsing markdown, such as, say, a
//! thematic break.
//! These things are called constructs here.
//! Sometimes, there are several constructs that result in an equivalent thing.
//! For example, [code (fenced)][code_fenced] and
//! [code (indented)][code_indented] are considered different constructs
//!
//! <!-- To do: can these rest things be made into constructs? -->
//!
//! Content types also have a *rest* thing: after all character escapes and
//! character references are parsed, thereâ€™s something left.
//! This remainder is, currently, not called a constructs.
//!
//! The following constructs are found in markdown:
//!
//! *   attention (strong, emphasis) (text)
//! *   [autolink][autolink]
//! *   [blank line][blank_line]
//! *   block quote
//! *   [character escape][character_escape]
//! *   [character reference][character_reference]
//! *   [code (fenced)][code_fenced]
//! *   [code (indented)][code_indented]
//! *   code (text)
//! *   content
//! *   definition
//! *   hard break escape
//! *   [heading (atx)][heading_atx]
//! *   heading (setext)
//! *   [html (flow)][html_flow]
//! *   [html (text)][html_text]
//! *   label end
//! *   label start (image)
//! *   label start (link)
//! *   list
//! *   paragraph
//! *   [thematic break][thematic_break]
//!
//! Each construct maintained here is explained with a BNF diagram.
//! For example, the docs for [character escape][character_escape] contain:
//!
//! ```bnf
//! character_escape ::= '\\' ascii_punctuation
//! ```
//!
//! Such diagrams are considered to be *non-normative*.
//! That is to say, they form illustrative, imperfect, but useful, examples.
//! The code, in Rust, is considered to be normative.
//!
//! They also contain references to character as defined by [char][], so for
//! example `ascii_punctuation` refers to
//! [`char::is_ascii_punctuation`][char::is_ascii_punctuation].
