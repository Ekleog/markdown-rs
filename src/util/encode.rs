//! Utilities to encode HTML.

/// Encode dangerous html characters.
///
/// This ensures that certain characters which have special meaning in HTML are
/// dealt with.
/// Technically, we can skip `>` and `"` in many cases, but CM includes them.
///
/// This behavior is not explained in prose in `CommonMark` but can be inferred
/// from the input/output test cases.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust ignore
/// use micromark::util::encode;
///
/// assert_eq!(encode("I <3 ðŸ¦€"), "I &lt;3 ðŸ¦€");
/// ```
///
/// ## References
