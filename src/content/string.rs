//! The string content type.
//!
//! **String** is a limited **text** like content type which only allows
//! character escapes and character references.
//! It exists in things such as identifiers (media references, definitions),
//! titles, URLs, code (fenced) info and meta parts.
//!
//! The constructs found in strin are:
//!
//! *   [Character escape][crate::construct::character_escape]
//! *   [Character reference][crate::construct::character_reference]
