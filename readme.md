# micromark-rs

Crate docs are currently at
[`wooorm.com/micromark-rs/micromark/`](https://wooorm.com/micromark-rs/micromark/).

Here be dragons!
üêâ
There‚Äôs a lot to do.
Some major to dos are described here, more smaller ones are in the code.

## Some useful scripts for now

Run examples:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example lib
```

Format:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
```

Lint:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

Tests:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test
```

Docs:

```sh
cargo doc --document-private-items
```

(add `--open` to open them in a browser)

## To do

### Some major obstacles

- [ ] (8) Can paragraphs (and to a lesser extent string data and text data)
      operate more performantly than checking whether other flow constructs
      start a line, before exiting and actually attempting flow constructs?
- [ ] (3) Interrupting: sometimes flow can or cannot start depending on the
      previous construct (typically paragraph)
- [ ] (5) Containers: this will be rather messy, and depends a lot on how
      subtokenization is solved
- [ ] (3) Concrete constructs: HTML or code (fenced) cannot be ‚Äúpierced‚Äù into by
      containers
- [ ] (3) Lazy lines, in containers, in flow in a paragraph, a line does not
      need to be indented
- [ ] (5) There‚Äôs a lot of rust-related choosing whether to pass (mutable)
      references or whatever around that should be refactored
- [ ] (5) Figure out extensions
- [ ] (1) Support turning off constructs

### All the things

#### Docs

- [ ] (1) `space_or_tab_one_line_ending`
- [ ] (1) `ParseState`
- [ ] (1) Image, Link, and other media token types; `LabelStart`, `Media`
- [ ] (1) Resolvers, push, feed, etc.
- [ ] (1) Go through all bnf
- [ ] (1) Go through all docs
- [ ] (1) Add overview docs on how everything works

#### Refactor

- [ ] (1) Use `edit_map` in `subtokenize`
- [ ] (1) Clean shifting, assertions in the above helper
- [ ] (1) Clean `space_or_tab_one_line_ending`
- [ ] (1) Use `link_to` (and `space_or_tab_one_line_ending`) in more places?
      It‚Äôs probably better
- [ ] (1) Force chunks in `link_to`, disallowing `LineEnding` and such
- [ ] (1) Clean feeding, resolving

#### Parse

- [ ] (1) Parse initial and final space_or_tab of paragraphs (in text)\
       test (`code_indented`, `definition`, `hard_break_escape`, `hard_break_trailing`,
      `heading_atx`, `heading_setext`, `html_flow`, `misc_soft_break`,
      `misc_tabs`, `thematic_break`)
- [ ] (3) Interrupting (html flow complete, definition + code_indented)
- [ ] (5) attention\
       test (`character_reference`, `hard_break_escape`, `hard_break_trailing`,
      `heading_atx`, `heading_setext`, `html_flow`, `thematic_break`)\
- [ ] (8) block quote\
       test (`code_fenced`, `definition`, `code_indented`, `heading_atx`, `heading_setext`,
      `html_flow`, `misc_default_line_ending`, `thematic_break`)
- [ ] (8) list\
       test (`character_reference`, `code_indented`, `heading_setext`,
      `html_flow`, `thematic_break`)\
       link (`blank line`, `thematic break`)
- [ ] (3) Lazy lines (`code indented`, `html flow`)
- [ ] (3) Concrete (`html flow`)
- [ ] (3) Turn off things (enable every test for these)
- [ ] (3) Make tokenizer tokens extendable

#### Test

- [ ] (1) Make sure positional info is perfect
- [ ] (3) Use `commonmark` tests
- [ ] (3) Share a bunch of tests with `micromark-js`

#### Misc

- [ ] (3) Check subtokenizer unraveling is ok
- [ ] (3) Remove splicing and cloning in subtokenizer
- [ ] (3) Pass more references around
- [ ] (1) Remove todos in `span.rs` if not needed
- [ ] (1) Get markers from constructs (`string`, `text`)
- [ ] (3) Clean compiler
- [ ] (3) Read through rust docs to figure out what useful functions there are,
      and fix stuff I‚Äôm doing manually now
- [ ] (5) Do some research on rust best practices for APIs, e.g., what to accept,
      how to integrate with streams or so?
- [ ] (1) Go through clippy rules, and such, to add strict code styles
- [ ] (1) Make sure that rust character groups match CM character groups (e.g., is
      `unicode_whitespace` or so the same?)
- [ ] (1) Any special handling of surrogates?
- [ ] (1) Make sure debugging, assertions are useful for other folks
- [ ] (3) Add some benchmarks (against comrak, pulldown-cmark, kramdown?), do some perf testing
- [ ] (3) Write comparison to other parsers
- [ ] (3) Add node/etc bindings?
- [ ] (3) Bunch of docs
- [ ] (5) Site

### Extensions

The main thing here is is to figure out if folks could extend from the outside
with their own code, or if we need to maintain it all here.
Regardless, it is essential for the launch of `micromark-rs` that extensions
are theoretically or practically possible.
The extensions below are listed from top to bottom from more important to less
important.

- [ ] (1) frontmatter (yaml, toml) (flow)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-frontmatter`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-frontmatter)

- [ ] (3) footnote (GFM) (flow, text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-gfm-footnote`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-footnote)
