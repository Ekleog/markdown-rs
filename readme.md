# micromark-rs

Crate docs are currently at
[`wooorm.com/micromark-rs/micromark/`](https://wooorm.com/micromark-rs/micromark/).

There‚Äôs still a lot to do, but, already: **100%** CommonMark ü•≥

## Some useful scripts for now

Run examples:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example lib
```

Format:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
```

Lint:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

Tests:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test
```

Docs:

```sh
cargo doc --document-private-items
```

(add `--open` to open them in a browser)

## To do

### Some major obstacles

- [ ] (5) There‚Äôs a lot of rust-related choosing whether to pass (mutable)
      references or whatever around that should be refactored
- [ ] (5) Figure out extensions

### All the things

#### Docs

- [ ] (1) Go through all bnf
- [ ] (1) Go through all docs
- [ ] (1) Add overview docs on how everything works

#### Refactor

- [ ] (1) Use `edit_map` in `subtokenize` (needs to support links in edits)
- [ ] (1) Improve `interrupt`, `concrete`, `lazy` fields somehow?

#### Parse

- [ ] (3) Make tokens extendable for extensions?

#### Test

- [ ] (1) Make sure positional info is perfect
- [ ] (3) Share a bunch of tests with `micromark-js`

#### Misc

- [ ] (3) `no_std`: remove all `HashSet`s/`HashMap` to use vecs, vecs w/ tuples?
- [ ] (3) Remove splicing and cloning in subtokenizer
- [ ] (3) Pass more references around
- [ ] (1) Get markers from constructs (`string`, `text`)
- [ ] (3) Read through rust docs to figure out what useful functions there are,
      and fix stuff I‚Äôm doing manually now
- [ ] (5) Do some research on rust best practices for APIs, e.g., what to accept,
      how to integrate with streams or so?
- [ ] (1) Go through clippy rules, and such, to add strict code styles
- [ ] (1) Any special handling of surrogates?
- [ ] (1) Make sure debugging, assertions are useful for other folks
- [ ] (3) Add some benchmarks (against comrak, pulldown-cmark, kramdown?), do some perf testing
- [ ] (3) Write comparison to other parsers
- [ ] (3) Add node/etc bindings?
- [ ] (3) Bunch of docs
- [ ] (5) Site

### Extensions

The main thing here is is to figure out if folks could extend from the outside
with their own code, or if we need to maintain it all here.
Regardless, it is essential for the launch of `micromark-rs` that extensions
are theoretically or practically possible.
The extensions below are listed from top to bottom from more important to less
important.

- [ ] (1) frontmatter (yaml, toml) (flow)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-frontmatter`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-frontmatter)
- [ ] (3) autolink literal (GFM) (text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-gfm-autolink-literal`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-autolink-literal)
- [ ] (3) footnote (GFM) (flow, text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-gfm-footnote`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-footnote)
- [ ] (3) strikethrough (GFM) (text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-gfm-strikethrough`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-strikethrough)
- [ ] (5) table (GFM) (flow)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-gfm-table`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-table)
- [ ] (1) task list item (GFM) (text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-gfm-task-list-item`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-task-list-item)
- [ ] (3) math (flow, text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-math`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-math)
- [ ] (8) directive (flow, text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-directive`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-directive)
- [ ] (8) expression (MDX) (flow, text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-mdx-expression`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdx-expression)
- [ ] (5) JSX (MDX) (flow, text)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-mdx-jsx`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdx-jsx)
- [ ] (3) ESM (MDX) (flow)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-mdxjs-esm`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdxjs-esm)
- [ ] (1) tagfilter (GFM) (n/a, renderer)
      ‚Äî [`micromark-extension-gfm-tagfilter`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-gfm-tagfilter)

#### After

- [ ] (8) After all extensions, including MDX, are done, see if we can integrate
      this with SWC to compile MDX
