# micromark-rs

Crate docs are currently at
[`wooorm.com/micromark-rs/micromark/`](https://wooorm.com/micromark-rs/micromark/).

Here be dragons!
üêâ
There‚Äôs a lot to do.
Some major to dos are described here, more smaller ones are in the code.

## Some useful scripts for now

Run examples:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example lib
```

Format:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
```

Lint:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

Tests:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test
```

Docs:

```sh
cargo doc --document-private-items
```

(add `--open` to open them in a browser)

## To do

### Some major obstacles

- [ ] (1) Setext headings: can they be solved in content, or do they have to be
      solved in flow somehow
- [ ] (8) Can content (and to a lesser extent string and text) operate more
      performantly than checking whether other flow constructs start a line,
      before exiting and actually attempting flow constructs?
- [ ] (5) Figure out definitions and sharing those identifiers, and references
      before definitions
- [ ] (3) Interrupting: sometimes flow can or cannot start depending on the
      previous construct (typically paragraph)
- [ ] (5) Containers: this will be rather messy, and depends a lot on how
      subtokenization is solved
- [ ] (3) Concrete constructs: HTML or code (fenced) cannot be ‚Äúpierced‚Äù into by
      containers
- [ ] (3) Lazy lines, in containers, in flow and content in a paragraph, a line
      does not need to be indented
- [ ] (5) There‚Äôs a lot of rust-related choosing whether to pass (mutable)
      references or whatever around that should be refactored
- [ ] (5) Figure out extensions
- [ ] (1) Support turning off constructs

### Small things

- [ ] (3) Fix deep subtokenization
- [ ] (1) Add docs to subtokenize
- [ ] (1) Add module docs to content
- [ ] (1) Add module docs to parser
- [ ] (1) Add examples to `CompileOptions` docs
- [ ] (1) Add overview docs on how everything works
- [ ] (1) Move safe protocols to constants
- [ ] (1) Parse initial and final whitespace of paragraphs (in text)
- [ ] (3) Clean compiler
- [ ] (1) Use preferred line ending style in markdown
- [ ] (1) Handle BOM at start
- [ ] (1) Make sure tabs are handled properly and that positional info is perfect
- [ ] (1) Make sure crlf/cr/lf are working perfectly
- [ ] (3) Figure out lifetimes of things (see `life time` in source)
- [ ] (3) Use `commonmark` tests
- [ ] (3) Share a bunch of tests with `micromark-js`
- [ ] (5) Do some research on rust best practices for APIs, e.g., what to accept,
      how to integrate with streams or so?
- [ ] (1) Go through clippy rules, and such, to add strict code styles
- [ ] (1) Make sure that rust character groups match CM character groups (e.g., is
      `unicode_whitespace` or so the same?)
- [ ] (1) Any special handling of surrogates?
- [ ] (1) Make sure debugging is useful for other folks
- [ ] (3) Add some benchmarks, do some perf testing
- [ ] (3) Write comparison to other parsers
- [ ] (3) Add node/etc bindings?
- [ ] (8) After all extensions, including MDX, are done, see if we can integrate
      this with SWC to compile MDX
- [ ] (3) Bunch of docs
- [ ] (5) Site

### Extensions

The main thing here is is to figure out if folks could extend from the outside
with their own code, or if we need to maintain it all here.
Regardless, it is essential for the launch of `micromark-rs` that extensions
are theoretically or practically possible.
The extensions below are listed from top to bottom from more important to less
important.
